# Tic-tac-toe

It's a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

This game uses [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), so win is impossible. Your perfect match may end in a draw, or you may lose, but there is no way you can beat the computer.

Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.
